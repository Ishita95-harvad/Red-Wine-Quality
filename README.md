Red Wine Quality Dataset

**📌 Overview**

This dataset contains physicochemical properties of red wine samples, along with their quality ratings. It is useful for predictive modeling, regression analysis, and classification tasks in food science and machine learning.

**📂 Data Format**

The dataset includes:
- Fixed Acidity – Concentration of non-volatile acids
- Volatile Acidity – Acetic acid content affecting taste
- Citric Acid – Natural preservative in wine
- Residual Sugar – Sugar left after fermentation
- Chlorides – Salt content in wine
- Free Sulfur Dioxide – Antioxidant and microbial control agent
- Total Sulfur Dioxide – Sum of free and bound SO₂
- Density – Wine density measurement
- pH – Acidity level of the wine
- Sulphates – Contributes to wine stability
- Alcohol – Alcohol percentage in wine
- Quality – Wine rating (scale of 0-10)
- 
**🔧 Installation**
